## About

This is a Computational Media Arts &amp; Cultures seminar on physical computing, creative coding, and the artistic affordances of the "Internet of Things" (IoT).  

The IoT represents a significant paradigm-shift in what it means to live in a networked society, an ecosystem where *machinic phyla* far exceed the population of networked humans.  This course considers the implications of this emergent digital ecology and seeks to equip students with the conceptual and technical skills necessary for critical and creative engagement with so-called “smart things.”  

Over the course of our semester together we will:  
* Learn Internet of Things fundamentals:  Arduino and Python programming, cloud communication protocols, circuit design, and physical prototyping
* Experiment with the artistic possibilities of networked micro-controllers and sensors.
* Discuss and debate the social, economic, and political implications of emerging technologies.
* Creatively engage issues and concepts through physical prototypes: ubiquitous dataveillance, medial materiality, e-waste and environmental impacts, machine intelligence, posthuman / nonhuman phenomenologies, securitization and risk.  

No prerequisites beyond a willingness to work hard, collaborate, learn, tinker, and play.
